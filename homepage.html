                <h1>History & society</h1>
                <p>
                    The relationship of film to the history of societies assumes several patterns. It is both a reflection and a source of history and may even constitute a historical event in its own right. In the first place, film—initially on the big screen, then on television—acts as an agent of history. Naturally its social and political impact is all the greater if the agencies or institutions that control production and distribution see themselves as propagators of an ideology. The extreme case is the propaganda film. The Nazis went furthest and were the most thorough in the development and production of this genre. They controlled and coordinated the script, the shooting, the selection of actors and the music, and assured distribution and screening by issuing 70,000 16 mm projectors in schools and universities from 1936; staging multiple premieres and offering free showings (for example Jud Süß), etc
There is no doubt that the Bolsheviks—above all Lunacharsky and Trotsky—were the first to divine that cinema would become an art for the masses and the art of the future, as well as an educational tool. They were able to contribute to the grandeur and the glory of Soviet motion pictures, but, unlike the Nazi leaders, they did not control all phases of production because, being members of the intelligentsia, as lawyers, professors, and physicians, they were unfamiliar with, filmmaking and were initially condescending toward the art. They were content to control the explicit denotation, the written screenplay, in the manner of an auditor. As a result, the big names in Soviet film (S. M. Eisenstein, Lev Kuleshov, Vsevolod Pudovkin, etc.), while sympathizers of the new regime, were capable of making films which, although criticizing the Tsarist past, did not really conform to the ruling ideology. This changed during the Stalin era, when a film like Chapayev expressed it very consciously. This work was a certain turning point, to the satisfaction of the rulers (1934).

                <h1>Science & Tech</h1>
                <p>
                    Science is the systematic study of the physical and natural world through observation and experiment. Technology is the application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes. 
Science and technology make life easier and more comfortable for humans. They enable us to save time and money, and open up new perspectives of understanding. 
Science and technology studies is an interdisciplinary field that examines the creation, development, and consequences of science and technology in their historical, cultural, and social contexts.
The development of technology paves way for research and development in the field of science. For example, space science is one of them. 
The Ministry of Science and Technology is the Indian government ministry charged with formulation and administration of the rules and regulations and laws relating to science and technology in India

                <h1>Biographies</h1>
                <p>
                    A biography is simply the story of a real person’s life. It could be about a person who is still alive, someone who lived centuries ago, someone who is globally famous, an unsung hero forgotten by history, or even a unique group of people. The facts of their life, from birth to death (or the present day of the author), are included with life-changing moments often taking center stage. The author usually points to the subject’s childhood, coming-of-age events, relationships, failures, and successes in order to create a well-rounded description of her subject.

Biographies require a great deal of research. Sources of information could be as direct as an interview with the subject providing their own interpretation of their life’s events. When writing about people who are no longer with us, biographers look for primary sources left behind by the subject and, if possible, interviews with friends or family. Historical biographers may also include accounts from other experts who have studied their subject.

                <h1>Animals & Nature</h1>
                <p>
                    Animals are an important part of nature and ecosystems. They play a role in: 
                    Nutrients: Some animals help bring nutrients into the cycle.
                    Decomposition: Other animals help with decomposition, carbon, and nitrogen cycles.
                    Food and fiber: Domesticated animals, such as livestock, provide food and fiber.
                    Healthy ecosystems: Wildlife supports healthy ecosystems.
                    Climate change mitigation: Large mammals can help reduce forest and bush fires, increase albedo, and retain carbon in vegetation and soil.
                    Animals are consumers, meaning they need to eat other organisms to survive. This limits the growth of the organisms they eat, preventing them from growing too numerous in population and using up too many resources. 
                    Animals are heterotrophic, eukaryotic, and multicellular. 
                     They have bodies made up of many different cells and eat other organisms to survive. Unlike plants or fungi, which are rooted in one place, animals move around to find food, escape from enemies, and find a mate. Almost all animals breathe oxygen, either from the air or from water.

                <p>
                    Planet Earth contains some extraordinarily diverse environments, some of which are easily habitable and some not so much. In different areas of Earth, one might find sweltering deserts, dense tropical rainforests, or bone-chilling tundras. Each biome and habitat comes with its own selection of flora and fauna, and it may include physical features such as canyons, volcanoes, rivers, or caves. Human beings have built homes in many different environments, settling the area and organizing it into units such as cities, states, regions, and countries, each with its own points of interest. Shifting trends in human migration have resulted in a human geography that is profoundly different from that of centuries ago.

                <h1>Money</h1>
                <p>
                    Money plays a fundamental role in the modern world, serving as a medium of exchange, a store of value, and a unit of account. It is the lifeblood of economies, facilitating transactions, enabling economic growth, and shaping the way societies function. Money takes various forms, from physical currency and coins to digital and cryptocurrency, adapting to the changing needs of a globalized world.

One of the primary functions of money is its role as a medium of exchange. It simplifies trade by providing a common measure of value. Instead of relying on barter, where goods and services are exchanged directly, money allows for the more efficient and flexible exchange of value. It simplifies complex transactions and fosters specialization, ultimately driving economic growth.

Money also serves as a store of value, allowing individuals and businesses to save their wealth for future use. This function is especially important in an uncertain world, where economic stability and financial security are paramount. People can save money for retirement, emergencies, or investment, knowing that it will retain its value over time.

Additionally, money functions as a unit of account, providing a standardized way to measure and compare the value of goods and services. Prices are expressed in monetary terms, making it easier for consumers to make informed choices and for businesses to set fair pricing.

The concept of money has evolved over centuries, from early forms like shells and cattle to the contemporary era of digital payments and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. As technology advances, the nature of money continues to change. Digital currencies, such as Bitcoin, offer the potential for more secure and efficient transactions while challenging traditional financial systems.

However, money is not without its challenges and controversies. Issues like inflation, inequality, and the risk of financial crises are associated with the use and management of money. Central banks and governments play a crucial role in regulating money supply and ensuring its stability.

In conclusion, money is a cornerstone of modern economies and societies. It simplifies trade, stores value, and serves as a unit of account, underpinning economic activities and shaping the world we live in. The evolution of money continues to influence the way we interact, invest, and plan for the future, making it a subject of constant interest and innovation.
